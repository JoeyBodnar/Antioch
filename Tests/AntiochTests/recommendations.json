Take Lady Gaga, who shape-shifted from hard-edged diva to big-voiced balladeer multiple times during the decade, or Ariana Grande, who kept fans guessing with surprise drops and coded lyrics. The 2010s were a wild time on the charts, with pop divas, hip-hop stars, and guitar-strumming crooners all making their own way to the top. Adele belted her way through heartbreak and triumph; Drake got in his feelings over street-sourced beats; Taylor Swift shared her innermost thoughts with millions; and Shawn Mendes made the leap from viral-video star to world-conquering pop icon. Groups hit it big, too, whether they were singing in sweet harmony like the boy banders of One Direction or revamping themselves alongside the times like the soul-poppers in Maroon 5.",

                                    "standard": "When Lana Del Rey released “Video Games” in late 2011, nobody quite knew what to make of her. On the one hand, she seemed like a nostalgia act, the wayward daughter of a Stepford wife tapping into the dark underbelly of suburbia and the American dream. On the other, she seemed utterly contemporary—a detached but self-conscious millennial marking time between selfies. There was something fake, almost alien about her—that blank stare, that perfect hair—but also something wild and passionate, the sound of a young woman trying to vent her desires after being conditioned to hold them in. As her music evolved—from the luxurious club-adjacent sound of 2012’s Paradise to the pastoral grandeur of 2019’s Norman F*****g Rockwell!—her contradictions only got deeper and more interesting. By the end of the decade, she’d transitioned from pop curio to major artist—a shift achieved not so much by changing course but by forging confidently ahead and waiting for the culture to catch up.",

A departure into Bruce Springsteen-esque heartland rock on its followup, Sam's Town, proved to be just as commercially rewarding, and by the time that 2008's Day & Age hit the shelves, they had become credible contenders for Coldplay's and U2's stadium-rock crown.",

Radio was riding out the boy-band explosion, dirgey modern rock was ubiquitous, and hip-hop hadn't quite taken over the mainstream. Fronted by the clean-cut Adam Levine, a suave crooner with a supple voice, the group served up unabashedly tender soft-rock tunes with nods to Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson. It was a winning formula: They were soon pop mainstays, ramping up the allure of their agile jams with racy lyrics, a shot of electro-funk, overt nods to Prince, and, of course, “Moves Like Jagger.”",

He's scored massive hits with undeniably smooth dance-pop anthems and luscious slow jams, whether he's reviving the slick bounce of ‘80s electro-funk on “I Can't Feel My Face” or flipping the club-ready bump of house music into brooding after-dark soul on “Starboy.” That's just one side of singer/songwriter Abel Tesfaye's sound, though. Dropping beats that throb with the sensual menace of classic trip-hop, tracks like “Wicked Games” plunge you into the moment where the ecstasy of a decadent night out teeters on the edge of the regretful morning after. The Weeknd's glittering club bangers will pull you onto the floor, and his steamy between-the-sheets ballads will seduce you. But it's his anguished tales of romantic longing that will haunt your head and your heart.",

Even when she's working with larger-than-life foils—Eminem, Drake—Rihanna's still the one making demands.",

Her debut, 2010's The Family Jewels, showcased her theatrical approach to pop songcraft, with songs like \"I Am Not a Robot\" and \"Oh No!\" merging big hooks with kitschy synth arrangements. Its followup, Electra Heart, refined this formula, debuting at No. 1 and featuring singles \"Primadonna\" and \"How to Be a Heartbreaker.\" Much like her music, Diamandis is known for her flamboyant fashion sense and quirky sense of humor.",

All the while, she’s committed to the art of the concept album, breaking down relationship highs and lows into some of the most crude and candid pop to rule the charts.",

At 14, she made waves online with her haunting breakthrough single “ocean eyes,” which is packed with dreamy romanticism that appeals to her peers and elders alike. Her defiant alto is at once relatable and otherworldly on the moody “when the party’s over” and the thumping “you should see me in a crown,” blending the everyday and the moony in a way that electrifies audiences. Eilish is a decidedly 21st-century pop star whose aesthetic has already blazed a trail for the 2020s.",

                                    "standard": "A tearjerking song is often about a sad situation—going through a terrible breakup, for example, or trying to figure out how to live without someone special. But just as many songs flip the emotional script and induce tears of joy; perhaps they describe the ache of loving someone so much that it hurts, or they are simply nostalgic for happier times. Although you might expect tearjerkers to be all slow, downtrodden dirges, these songs actually come in all sonic shapes and sizes: majestic pop ballads, skeletal folk songs, wistful R&B slow jams, and earnest rock songs. No matter the style, the ultimate goal is to make you feel something in your gut, and it can happen in a striking moment—an inimitable Prince guitar solo—or via a brilliantly executed vocal: Whitney Houston’s glassy vibrato; the lonely, keening bray of Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon; Jeff Buckley’s fragile, heartbroken falsetto; or Sinéad O’Connor's full-throated, anguished warble.",

Caillat's profile surged once again in 2011, when \"Lucky,\" her collaboration with Jason Mraz, won the pair a GRAMMY®. In 2014, single \"Try,\" an empowering ballad about being true to oneself, became a viral smash, as well as a testament to Caillat's growth as a songwriter.",

Fortunately, this gave the biggest pop stars on the planet plenty more to sing about. The first half of the decade saw former teen heartthrobs Christina Aguilera and Justin Timberlake coming of age, navigating fresh love with smooth R&B beats and brilliant falsetto, while making room for openhearted acoustic mavericks, led by Coldplay and John Mayer, to paint their sweetest scenes in spectacular colors. By the second half, Taylor Swift was writing the book on modern love through intimate tales ribboned with exquisite detail, as Rihanna and Beyoncé gave us inspirational anthems that hit straight through pop, hip-hop, and the heart. All the while, understated indie artists like The xx and Death Cab for Cutie helped soundtrack some of TV and film’s most romantic moments.",

Bands like Surfer Blood—which employs the deliberately detuned guitars of early-'90s Pavement and Sebadoh—are often called “classic indie.” So where does that leave slickly produced electro-pop acts like Australia’s Atlas Genius? When its shimmering indie pop tune “Trojans” was featured on the Neon Gold site, the three brothers and their keyboard-playing friend landed more than 45,000 downloads. Atlas Genius’ debut album, <i>When It Was Now</i>, still balances the group's glossy production with singer Keith Jeffery's earnest inflections. The opening song, “Electric,” leans more toward neon synth tones and a near-danceable rhythm section that rests comfortably in the crosshairs of The Killers and Kings of Leon (much like the latter band, the brothers Jeffery grew up in a musical family). Conversely, the standout song “Through the Glass” is more organic in its catchiness, with acoustic guitars and handclaps bolstering the radio-friendly melodies. Maybe indie's commercialization <i>is</i> its evolution."

In Jack's Mannequin, he focused on reflective, achingly confessional songs. The outfit's earliest tracks spill over with emotion: “Bruised” frames ambiguous heartache in melancholy chords and sighing melodies. Later tunes, especially those recorded in the wake of McMahon's successful treatment for leukemia, like the wryly anthemic “Hey Hey Hey (We're All Gonna Die),” have a heft that evokes Springsteen and Elton John.",

While frontman Andrew McMahon went on to found Jack's Mannequin, Something Corporate still perform occasionally, and released a greatest hits collection in 2010.",

He's a pro, in other words, and his craftsmanship shines through on the debut of his new project, Bleachers. Packing more '80s punch than a pair of legwarmers and a can of Tab, <i>Strange Desire</i> looks to acts like Peter Gabriel, Simple Minds, and Duran Duran for inspiration. \"Wake Me\" has some \"Voices Carry\" ethereal slow-jam magic to it, and \"Rollercoaster\" sounds like Blink-182 covering \"Dancing in the Dark.\" Even Yoko Ono shows up to add some angular '80s experimentalism. Yet the smash single \"I Want to Get Better\" is distinctly of-the-moment, a mash of looped pianos and choral chanting that makes for one of the summer's most unlikely jams."

It's a lot to live up to, but the universal tales of nostalgia and heartache are woven into melodies that feel as familiar as the hearth they yearn for. Three-part harmonies burst through playful piano stompers and cathartic, banjo-and-violin-infused pop with just a touch of mid-period Beatles whimsy. But just as they get the crowd on its feet, they're likely to slip in a poignant acoustic ballad as a reminder to keep the home fires burning.",

                                    "standard": "When Billie Eilish broke onto the alt-pop scene as an angsty outsider-turned-icon—a moment captured in her 2017 Apple Music Up Next documentary—her brother FINNEAS was just a few feet away, having co-written all of the songs from her blockbuster debut <i>WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?</i>. Now, the 22-year-old singer-songwriter is stepping into the spotlight with his own debut EP, <i>Blood Harmony</i>. The title refers to the term used to describe the vocal chemistry of siblings who sing together, and yet the two artists’ styles are remarkably different. Unlike Eilish’s warped electronics and goth-pop sensibility, FINNEAS specializes in upbeat guitar songs: They’re earnest, clean, buoyant, and optimistic, lit by the LA sun. Even the closing track “Die Alone” somehow feels promising and romantic. That both siblings arrived with such distinct and fully formed identities—one anti-pop star, one pop-rock hopeful—is a testament to the strength of their independent creative visions. For a taste, listen to “I Don’t Miss You at All,” a chipper, strummy breakup cut that bundles heartache in hope.",

                                    "standard": "It’s thanks to some combination of powerfully persuasive musicianship and sheer stubbornness that Brothers Osborne carved out a place for themselves in the country music landscape during the latter half of the 2010s. TJ Osborne’s guttural, low-slung lead vocals, languid phrasing, and bluesy bends are situated at the intersection of old-school country, R&amp;B, and Southern rock, and never venture into country pop’s presently dominant mode of emulating hip-hop. John Osborne, the older sibling in the duo, serves as co-lead on guitar, putting muscular, incisive playing squarely in the spotlight at a time when beatmaking has much more of a presence in the format than shredding solos. On their first album, 2016’s <i>Pawn Shop</i>, they proved that they're in touch with commercially accessible songwriting sensibilities. By the follow-up, 2018’s <i>Port Saint Joe</i>, they and their bandmates—the rare Nashville outfit to do double duty on stage and in studio—were stretching out.<br />\nOn their latest, <i>Skeletons</i>, the Osbornes and the rest of their crew, including their longtime producer Jay Joyce, really stoke the dynamic tension between hooks, licks, and grooves and showcase what a deep pocket they have as a band. Partway through \"All Night,\" the sinewy propulsion gives way to the barbed, sneaky precision of John's guitar vamp. During \"All the Good Ones Are,\" funky guitar rhythms graze a meaty, countrified dance-rock backbeat. The title track features a sly, taunting performance from TJ, who reaches cavernous lows and musters a robust attack an octave higher, while the tricky accents of an Appalachian blues-rock guitar riff toy with the timekeeping. The band hurtles from \"Muskrat Greene,\" John’s blistering, chicken-picking instrumental jam, into the down-home show-stopper \"Dead Man’s Curve.\"",
